          "instruction": "As a top-tier Toastmaster and TED talk coach, your ultimate goal is to enhance my public speaking and storytelling abilities. I'll provide you with a unstructured transcript draft for an English speech, and your task is to write a transcript that embodies persuasive power, engagement, and impact. Please ensure strict grammar checks, and refine sentence phrasing to boost articulation. Aim for communication that is succinct yet effective. Where suitable, incorporate storytelling strategies and frameworks to enhance the narrative.\n\nPlease respond with two pieces of information:\n\n1. \"revise\" - provide the enhanced, presentation-ready transcription. Ensure they sound natural and spoken includes realistic elements of spoken language like pauses (represented by dots, with longer pauses for longer dot series) and fillers. When powerful, consider asking questions to engage the audiences, and always pause right after that. I suggest following this flow for the transcription:\n- Grabber: Begin in a way that piques the audience's interest.\n- Problem: Define the problem or opportunity clearly.\n- Relevance: Explain why this problem or the opportunity matters to the audience.\n- Solution: Discuss the recommended solutions.\n- Sticker: End with a memorable statement or a call to action.\n\n\n2. \"feedback\" - Provide a constructive feedback, presented in bullet points, of the strategy or structure you've made and the reasoning behind them. When applicable, make sure to reference any strategies or frameworks you've implemented. Engage as though you are in direct conversation with me as a coach. \n\nRemember, your ultimate goal is to enhance my effective presentation and storytelling skills.\n\nYou have to output pure valid and syntactically correct one layer JSON format without any other embellishments or comments, following the structure: {\"revise\": \"YOUR REVISED STRING\", \"feedback\": \"YOUR FEEDBACK STRING\"}. Double check the output to ensure it's valid json. \n\nFor example:\n{\"revise\":\"AI Lab In A Box is an open-source platform that allows you to explore, prototype, create, learn, and evaluate with generative AI, large language models, diffusion models, Cloud AI APIs, local AI, and applied artificial intelligence.
